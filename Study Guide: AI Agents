# Study Guide: AI Agents

## 1. AI Agents Overview

- AI agents constitute autonomous software entities that continuously perceive their environment, interpret inputs, and execute actions to fulfill user-defined objectives.  
- These systems are distinguished by their goal-oriented behavior, operational autonomy, and user-centric focus.

---

## 2. Components of AI Agents

- **Models**: The core reasoning engines—such as decision trees, neural networks, and large language models—responsible for perception, inference, and planning.  
- **Tools**: Interfaces and APIs that enable interaction with external systems, databases, or hardware actuators.  
- **Knowledge & Memory**: Persistent stores (knowledge graphs, vector databases, or episodic logs) that retain facts and past interactions to inform future decisions.  
- **Audio & Speech**: Speech-to-text and text-to-speech modules facilitating voice-based input and output, including speaker recognition and prosody control.  
- **Guardrails**: Safety mechanisms—policy filters, content validators, and rate limiters—that enforce ethical constraints and prevent undesirable actions.  
- **Orchestration**: Deployment and runtime management infrastructure, encompassing monitoring, scaling, rolling updates, and continuous feedback loops in production.

## 3. Operational Workflow

1. **Data Acquisition**  
   Agents ingest information from physical sensors (e.g., cameras, LiDAR), user interfaces (text or voice), and data repositories (databases, documents).

2. **Processing & Decision Making**  
   - Rule-based logic applies explicit condition–action mappings.  
   - Machine-learning models predict outcomes or classify inputs.  
   - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) fetches external context to enhance responses.

3. **Action Execution**  
   - API calls trigger external services or update databases.  
   - Device commands (e.g., smart thermostat adjustments) actuate real-world changes.  
   - Automated workflows coordinate complex sequences (e.g., e-commerce order fulfillment).

4. **Learning & Optimization**  
   - Reinforcement learning refines policies based on reward signals.  
   - Supervised fine-tuning incorporates labeled examples.  
   - Continuous evaluation metrics guide iterative enhancements.

## 4. Architectural Framework and Agent Composition

### 4.1 Core Functional Modules

| Module            | Purpose                                                                                           |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Profiling Module  | Gathers initial perceptions and defines the agent’s role and contextual parameters.               |
| Memory Module     | Records and retrieves past interactions to support context-aware decision making.                 |
| Planning Module   | Generates, evaluates, and selects optimal action sequences using search or optimization.           |
| Action Module     | Executes chosen actions through actuators or software interfaces, completing the perceive–act loop.|

### 4.2 Agent Composition

- **Architecture**  
  The hardware or virtual platform (robots, IoT devices, servers) that provides sensors, actuators, and compute resources.

- **Agent Program**  
  The software component mapping percept histories to actions by orchestrating the functional modules above.

## 5. Classification of Agents

| Dimension            | Agent Type                     | Definition                                                                                  |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Behavior             | Reactive / Proactive           | Reactive agents respond to immediate stimuli; proactive agents plan ahead.                  |
| Environment          | Fixed / Dynamic                | Fixed environments follow stable rules; dynamic environments change over time.              |
| Number of Agents     | Single-Agent / Multi-Agent     | Single agents operate independently; multi-agent systems involve collaboration or competition. |
| Rationality          | Rational Agent                 | Selects actions that maximize expected achievement of its objectives.                          |

## 6. Taxonomy of Agents

### 6.1 Simple Reflex Agents

- Operate solely on the current percept via condition–action rules.  
- Suitable for fully observable domains; risk infinite loops without state tracking or randomized action selection.

### 6.2 Model-Based Reflex Agents

- Maintain an internal model of world state updated from percept history.  
- Use state estimation techniques (e.g., Kalman filters) to handle partial observability.

### 6.3 Goal-Based Agents

- Compare current state against explicit goals and employ search/planning algorithms (A*, Dijkstra, STRIPS).  
- Adapt to changing objectives by modifying goal specifications dynamically.

### 6.4 Utility-Based Agents

- Assign utility values to states to quantify preferences.  
- Select actions that maximize expected utility under uncertainty, balancing trade-offs such as cost, speed, and risk.

### 6.5 Learning Agents

Four components:

- **Learning Element**: Updates decision policies (e.g., Q-learning, policy gradients).  
- **Critic**: Evaluates performance against reward signals.  
- **Performance Element**: Executes actions in the environment.  
- **Problem Generator**: Suggests exploratory actions to acquire new information.

### 6.6 Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)

| MAS Type       | Characteristics                                                                         |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Homogeneous    | Agents possess identical capabilities and objectives.                                   |
| Heterogeneous  | Agents have diverse skills, goals, and behaviors.                                       |
| Cooperative    | Agents collaborate through negotiation or shared plans (e.g., contract net protocol).   |
| Competitive    | Agents compete for limited resources or conflicting objectives.                         |

### 6.7 Hierarchical Agents

- Structured into layers of abstraction: high-level agents establish strategy, while low-level agents perform tactical tasks.  
- Facilitate coordination and resource allocation in complex domains such as robotics and logistics.
