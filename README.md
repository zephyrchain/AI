# ZephyrChain AI

A modular, reference-quality repository of AI agent study notes, guides, and best practices—designed for cloud architects, engineers, and AI enthusiasts.

## What’s Inside

- **Core Concepts**  
  Concise overviews of AI agents: definitions, workflows (perceive–decide–act), and key characteristics (autonomy, reactivity, adaptability).

- **Architecture & Components**  
  Deep dives into profiling, memory, planning, and action modules—plus orchestration, guardrails, and tooling for production environments.

- **Agent Taxonomy**  
  Breakdown of agent types (simple reflex, model-based, goal-based, utility-based, learning, multi-agent, hierarchical) with real-world examples and design patterns.

- **Engineering Practices**  
  Prompt and context engineering techniques to guide language models and large-scale agents, complete with examples of chain-of-thought prompts and context management.

- **Evaluation Frameworks**  
  Guidelines and tools for benchmarking agent performance: automated rule checks, LM-based scoring, and human evaluation metrics.

- **Hands-On Exercises**  
  Step-by-step projects—build a vacuum-cleaner agent, implement A* pathfinding, simulate multi-agent interactions, and explore hierarchical RL.

## How to Use

1. Browse the `/docs` folder for structured markdown guides.
